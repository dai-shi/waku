# Chapter One

## Getting Started

To create a new **Waku** project run the following command in your terminal:

```
npm create waku@latest
```

Follow the CLI instructions and name the project something like `waku-tutorial`. Then open the project, install dependencies, and run the development server:

```bash
cd waku-tutorial
npm install
npm run dev
```

Now open up your browser and go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/). You should see a simple Waku app with an interactive counter.

Letâ€™s take a look at the files and code that we were given:

- `/src/pages` contains our [layouts and pages](https://waku.gg/#routing)
- `/src/components` contains our reusable [UI components](https://react.dev/learn/your-first-component)
- `/public` contains our [static assets](https://waku.gg/#static-assets)

## Server Components

If we take a deeper look at `/src/pages/index.tsx`, we notice that our component is an `async` [server component](https://waku.gg/#server-components):

```tsx
// line 5
export default async function HomePage() {
  const data = await getData();
  // ...rest of the file
}
```

This allows us to make an `async` call to get some data that happens securely on the server.

**Server components** can access files and databases directly, keep the client bundle size smaller, and perform other server-side logic! Keep in mind that they only run once on the server (i.e., they never re-render).

## Client Components

Go ahead and open up `/src/components/counter.tsx`:

```tsx
'use client';

import { useState } from 'react';

export const Counter = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  // ...rest of the file
};
```

As you can see on top of the file, it contains a `'use client'` directive. This tell us it (and any components it imports) will be **client components**. These are the traditional React components that weâ€™ve come to know and love, which can use all of the familiar React client API such as `useEffect` and `useState`.

## Routing

To handle routing in Waku, there is a familiar **[pages router](https://waku.gg/#routing)**.

Everything thatâ€™s inside the `/src/pages` directory abides by the routerâ€™s rules:

- `/pages/_layout.tsx` is a [layout](https://waku.gg/#layouts)
- `/pages/index.tsx` is a single route page
- `/pages/about.tsx` is a single route page

As you can see, thereâ€™s two ways to create **pages**:

1. use an `index` file (e.g., `/pages/contact/index.tsx`)
2. use a single named file (e.g., `/pages/contact.tsx`)

Either of these would render under the `/contact` route.

**Layouts** are created with the special `_layout.tsx` filename and are how we create a shared layout that wraps a route and its descendents.

The layout at `/pages/_layout.tsx` is the [root layout](https://waku.gg/#root-layout), which wraps the entire site. Layouts can be nested as well, which weâ€™ll see in later chapters. Weâ€™ll also discover **segment routes**, **nested segment routes**, and **catch-all routes** as well as Wakuâ€™s two rendering methods: **static prerendering** at build time and **dynamic rendering** at request time.

## And thatâ€™s all you need to get started

In the next chapters weâ€™ll dive deeper into everything to understand how powerful, but simple Waku is! ðŸ™‚

## Next Steps

In **Chapter 2** we will start building a small **Todo Application** to get some hands on experience with Waku.

Youâ€™ll learn more about server components, client components, router, navigation, and more!
