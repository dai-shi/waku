# Chapter One 

## Getting Started

To create a new **Waku** project run the following command

```
npm create waku@latest
```

Follow the cli instructions and name the project `waku-tutorial` 

Open the project, install dependencies, and run the development server 

```
cd waku-tutorial
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open up your browser and go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/) 

You should see a simple web page with an **interactive** **counter**!

*Lets take a look* at the code/files that we were given

- `/src/pages`  contains our [routes and layouts](https://waku.gg/#routing)
- `/src/components` contains our reusable [UI components](https://react.dev/learn/your-first-component)
- `/public` contains our [static assets](https://waku.gg/#static-assets)

## Server Components

If we take a deeper look at `/src/pages/index.tsx` we see our component is an `async` [server component](https://waku.gg/#server-components)

```tsx
// line 5
export default async function HomePage() { 
	const data = await getData();
	// ...rest of the file
}
```

that allows us to make an `async` call to get some data that happens on the server.

**Server components** can access our **db** directly, keep the client bundle size smaller, and other server-side logic! Keep in mind that they only run once on the server (ie: they don’t re-render)

## Client Components

Go ahead and open up `/src/components/counter.tsx` .

```tsx
'use client';

import { useState } from 'react';

export const Counter = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  	// ...rest of the file
}
```

As you can see on top of the file it contains `'use client'` and we’re using `useState`; so this tell us it's a **client component**. These are simply the **react components** that we've come to know and love; allowing us to use all of the familiar **react api** such as `useEffect` and `useState`. 

## Routing

To handle routing in **Waku**, there is a familiar **[Pages Router](https://waku.gg/#routing)**. 

Everything that is inside our `/src/pages` abides by the router’s rules

- `/pages/index.tsx` **index route**
- `/pages/_layout.tsx` **[layout](https://waku.gg/#layouts)**
- `/pages/about.tsx` **single route**

Theres two ways to create a page route.

1. use an `index` file. (eg: `/pages/contact/index.tsx`)
2. use a single named route (eg: `/pages/contact.tsx`)

Either of these would render under http://localhost:3000/contact


**Layouts** are how we create a shared *layout* for a route and its inner routes.

In our project `/pages/_layout.tsx` is the [root layout](https://waku.gg/#root-layout) for all of our routes currently. **Layouts** can be nested as-well, which we'll see later.

We *also have* **segment routes**, **nested segment routes**, and **catch-all routes**! In the following chapters we'll go over these and our two rendering options when we start building small projects.

## And that’s all you need to get started using Waku!

In the next Chapters we will dive deeper into everything so you get a good understanding of how powerful but simple **Waku** is 🙂

## Next Steps

In **Chapter 2** we will start building a small **Todo Application** to get some hands on experience with **Waku**. 

You’ll learn more about the **Server Components**, **Client Components**, **Routing**, **Navigation**, and more!
