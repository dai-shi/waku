### Redirects

Redirects are not handled by Waku directly. Instead, you can use either a custom middleware or the hosting environment to achieve that. The `<Link />` component does not deal with redirects either and will by default show the **404** page instead. To resolve this, you have to add an additional redirect for each redirected path, that points Waku to the correct `RSC` file. If there is a redirect from `/old` to `/new`, there also has to be one from `/RSC/old.txt`` to `/RSC/new.txt`to make the `<Link />` component`s smooth page transition work.

> The `/RSC/` file naming convention is [subject to change](https://github.com/dai-shi/waku/discussions/929#discussioncomment-10825975) in future versions of Waku.

#### Redirect via middleware

Create a new middleware somewhere in your project and add it to the `waku.config.ts` file.

```typescript
// ./src/middleware/redirect.ts
import type { Middleware } from 'waku/config';

const redirectsMiddleware: Middleware = () => async (ctx, next) => {
  // Define the list of redirects.
  const redirects = {
    '/old': '/new',
    // ... add more redirects here
  };

  // Create a corresponding /RSC/ entry for each redirect.
  const withRSC = Object.fromEntries(
    Object.entries(redirects).flatMap(([from, to]) => [
      [from, to],
      [`/RSC${from}.txt`, `/RSC${to}.txt`],
    ]),
  );

  if (withRSC[ctx.req.url.pathname]) {
    ctx.res.status = 301;
    ctx.res.headers = {
      Location: redirects[ctx.req.url.pathname],
    };
  } else {
    return await next();
  }
};

export default redirectsMiddleware;
```

```typescript
// ./waku.config.ts
import type { Config } from 'waku/config';

export default {
  middleware: () => [
    import('./src/middleware/redirects.js'),
    import('waku/middleware/dev-server'),
    import('waku/middleware/headers'),
    import('waku/middleware/rsc'),
    import('waku/middleware/ssr'),
  ],
} satisfies Config;
```

#### Redirect via hosting environment

This very much depends on the hosting environment you are using. For example, on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/docs/projects/project-configuration#redirects) you can use the `vercel.json` file to define redirects.

```json
{
  "redirects": [
    { "source": "/old", "destination": "/new", "permanent": true },
    {
      "source": "/RSC/old.txt",
      "destination": "/RSC/new.txt",
      "permanent": true
    }
  ]
}
```

[Netlify](https://docs.netlify.com/routing/redirects/#syntax-for-the-redirects-file) and [Cloudflare pages](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/configuration/redirects/) will respect a `_redirects` file that you can place in the `public` folder:
bbb

```
/old /new 301
/RSC/old.txt /RSC/new.txt 301
```
