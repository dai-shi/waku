## Setup TailwindCSS v4 inside a Waku app

Prepare your Waku app to use the v4 standards of TailwindCSS to prevent unnecessary rewrites in the future.

### Prerequisites

This setup can be done inside a new or existing Waku app. For ease of explaination I'll assume you have a new Waku app.

### Step 1: Install TailwindCSS v4

First, let's install the latest version of TailwindCSS:

```bash
pnpm remove autoprefixer
pnpm install postcss@latest tailwindcss@next @tailwindcss/postcss@next
```

### Step 2: Setup your TailwindCSS StyleSheet

Open the CSS entryfile of your Waku app, usually located at `src/styles.css` and add the following content:

```css
@import 'tailwindcss';
@import 'tailwindcss/utilities';
```

### Step 3: Setup PostCSS

Edit the `postcss.config.js` file in the root of your Waku app and add the following content:

```js
/** @type {import('postcss-load-config').Config} */
export default {
  plugins: {
    '@tailwindcss/postcss': {},
  },
};
```

### Configuration

As of writing, the javascript/typescript based config file doesn't get used by TailwindCSS v4. You can on the other hand use the CSS-First aproach to change or add entries to the theme.

[Read more about the CSS-First aproach here](https://tailwindcss.com/blog/tailwindcss-v4-alpha#css-first-configuration)

Example:

```css
@import 'tailwindcss';

@theme {
  --font-family-display: 'Satoshi', 'sans-serif';
  /** ^ can be called using the `font-display` utility for instance */

  --breakpoint-3xl: 1920px;

  --color-neon-pink: oklch(71.7% 0.25 360);
  --color-neon-lime: oklch(91.5% 0.258 129);
  --color-neon-cyan: oklch(91.3% 0.139 195.8);
}
```

After the before mentioned steps, you should be able to use TailwindCSS v4 in your Waku app.
