## Issues with Two Instances of React

Example error:

```
TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'use')
```

This issue can sometimes occur in `pnpm` workspaces. In such cases, configuring Vite may resolve the problem.

`vite.config.ts`:

```ts
import { defineConfig } from 'vite';

export default defineConfig({
  resolve: {
    dedupe: ['react', 'react-dom'],
  },
});
```
