Continuing our holiday retrospective of Waku’s recent features, today we’re excited to highlight type-safe routing. This addition brings compile-time safety to your routing and navigation logic while staying true to Waku’s minimalist principles.

## Type-safe routing

### Configuration

While support for loose typing comes out of the box, you can opt into further type inference in TypeScript projects by adding `as const` assertions to the return of `getConfig` for each of your project’s routes.

```tsx
// ./src/pages/valid/[slug].tsx

export default async function SomePage() { ... }

export const getConfig = async () => {
  const staticPaths = await getStaticPaths();

  return {
    render: 'static',
    staticPaths,
  } as const; // NEW!
};

const getStaticPaths = async () => { ... }
```

### Developer experience

Afterwards enjoy type checks and IDE autocompletion for the `<Link>` component’s `to` prop as well as parameters of `useRouter()` methods like `router.push()`.

```tsx
'use client';

import { Link, useRouter } from 'waku';

const Component = () => {
  const router = useRouter();

  return (
    <>
      <Link to="/invalid/link">Wrong link</Link>
      <button onClick={() => router.push('/invalid/path')}>Wrong path</button>
    </>
  );
};
```

### Type generation

Note that a new `pages.gen.ts` file is present in your project. Check this file into your code repository for compile-time type checking in your CI/CD pipeline.

## Bundle up for more...
There’s still more to explore in our series of recent Waku improvements. Next week, we’ll unwrap another exciting development. Warm wishes!
